It is used by Google to train models for a variety of applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition.\\n\\nDUS is not a standalone product, but rather a framework that is used by Google's internal machine learning teams to build and train their own models. It is not available for public use, but Google has released a number of other machine learning tools and libraries, such as TensorFlow and TensorFlow Lite, that are available for use by developers and researchers.\""
